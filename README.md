# Hi, I’m Seth Bywater (@sethbywater)

I'm currently finishing my degree in Mechatronics Technology at Suny Delhi. During my time here, I've enjoyed getting my hands dirty designing controls systems and installing them myself. Learning 3D design and simulation has been another highlight.

Programming, mostly in Rust, has been a personal pursuit of mine. Even without a formal education, the spirit of optimization and creative problem solving which drew me to engineering is as present in algorithms as it is in electric motor design.

Find me at [my webiste](sethbywater.com).

The best way to contact me is at seth@sethbywater.com.
